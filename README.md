# Not Sure of the Name
---
Imagine playing dnd with your friends, online, and you pass by another party, on a seperate mission.
Later, when your party is at an inn for the night, you get word of a party who just dethroned a known
corrupt government official. A wave of people flood into the dining area and start murmuring about
them. The room goes silent as the party from earlier walks in. They are battered and bruised and
they each have deep personalities. At this point, you realize your DM cannot create so many characters
that are so unique and in depth. Your party has interacted with a few different parties like this
and each time you're amazed with the realisim of the characters. Then you realize that those people
are real. They formed a party and went on a quest, returned from the quest, and now plan to spend
the night in rooms accross from your party.

This is the vision I have for this website.
